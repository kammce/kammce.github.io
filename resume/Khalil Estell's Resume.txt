At
Stinger
Ghaﬀarian
Technologies Inc. located in
the NASA Ames Research
Center in San Jose, I
designed a Python backed
web
application
for
recording equipment sent to
and from the ISS from the
SPHERES group.

At CrossTrac Engineering,
Inc, I wrote Python software
to parse RS232 packets
from
the
satellite
management
unit
and
converted the packets into
a dictionary data structure.
The software was memory
eﬃcient, fast, and fault
tolerant.

At Stanford University for the
Stanford
Pre-Collegiate
Summer Institutes (SPCS)
program where my team
worked
setup
and
maintained
18+
labs
computers
with
400+
computer
across
the
campus for the program.

For the Introduction to
Engineering course at San
Jose State University, where
I assisted in helping students
with their in lab assignments
for 3D modeling CAD
software, building turbine
towers,
and
building
autonomous robots.
